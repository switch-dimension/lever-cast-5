> üë©‚Äçüéì This is the repository for the LeverCast project. It is not complete and is still under development. It does not contain any seed files for the database and is not in a fully working state. It is only meant to be used as a reference for the course. As the final modules are released, I will update the repository.


## Course Module Checkpoints

To start working from a specific course module, you can checkout the corresponding commit. Follow these steps:

1. First, clone the repository if you haven't already:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/lever-cast-5.git
   cd lever-cast-5
   ```

2. List all available module tagged checkpoints (every commit has a hash and message and I'm also tagging selected points with a tage name I recommend you use)
   ```bash
   git tag
   ```

3. Checkout the desired module checkpoint as a new branch:(Creating a new branch which you can name yourself. This allows you to work on a specific module without affecting other modules, or just download the whole project and start from the latest commit, or just use the project whole as reference)
   ```bash
   git checkout -b <new_branch_name> <tag_name>
   ```

4. Install dependencies for that version: (This installs all the modules we need from the cloud for the project "Dependencies")
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

5. Set up your environment variables as specified in the module instructions

Note: Make sure to commit or stash any changes before checking out a different checkpoint.

Latest Recommended checkpoints:
- tag "template-create-module" Commit Hash: `7852a9b30769dbb118aca129140819a2682f080f`: Feature: Enhance platform preview (This is the latest checkpoint at the Templates setup Lesson)
